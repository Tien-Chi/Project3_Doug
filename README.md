## Project idea

Welcome home box

Inspiration: Gatebox (https://gatebox.ai/home/)

I really wanted to use the speech recognition in p5 so I had the idea of a device that would say welcome home and ask “how’s your day?” and based on the response the device might react in different ways.
Components

•	Switch to turn the device on – metaphor for coming home and turning the lights on

•	LED lights – adds visual ques to the device, different patterns can relate to different actions the user need to input

•	Website – displays text and responses

P5 bot – for LED code

Fascial expression (emojis? Doesn’t have to be digital, can be lights)

Projection? Or Robot (with visual interest)

Projection – doormat

Simple thing? 

Something you carry around the day (sticker on) – smart watches, bag, jacket (non-visual interest)

•	Knows how your day has been but still askes how your day has been

•	Know events that happened in your day

## Semi-final idea – Lock screen
A device placed on a door that acts like a AI that asks you how your day is. The AI wants to make you happy so if you give it a negative response(Bad) it would not open. It will try to make you smile in different ways (animal pictures/funny pictures) so when you smile the door would open.

The keeps angry or drunk persons from entering home?

## Production ideas
•	Illustration board as a door

•	Box container for the Arduino

•	Using the projector to project the screen onto the door OR phone screenshare

•	“A smiling face from its owner could lead to a 'bonus'” - Sean 

•	How the door opens using motor

o	Sliding door

o	String attached to the door and pulls on the door

## Ideal user experience
•	The user comes home and put their hand on the knob

•	A screen appears that asks how your day

•	If the person says good and smiles the door opens

•	If the person says bad, the door will ask if it should cheer them up

o	Saying yes will show a cute picture, trying to make the user smile, then opens the door

o	Saying no, will make the door sad and (not open/open very slowly)

## Presentation Doc
•	Visualization of the project

•	Project Statement, must be in a succinct format

•	Project Value/Rationale/Concept

•	Inspiration/Visual Research, examples of similar projects, influences on your direction
