## Project Statement

We designed a robot that wakes up the user in bed and gives a reward for getting up.

## Ideation
We started looking into AI and how people interact with them. Smart devices are everywhere in our homes now with things like Google Home, or Alexa that answer questions and are powerful A.I.s.  We wanted the AI we were making to have a bit more of a personality. Seeing inspiration like “Gatebox”, an anime figure with an personality as an AI, we thought we could build a small robot with the ability to do a small task. 

## Inspiration:
•	Gatebox (https://gatebox.ai/home/)

•	Mars Rovers
